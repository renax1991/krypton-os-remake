Hello! Welcome to the Krypton OS main source tree.

This is the x86 implementation of the Krypton uKernel concept,
integrated into the vfsDOS project, one of the many projects ran by our
team, widely based on the inner workings of the AmigaOS Exec kernel, but
with, or so we hope, much more modern features such as memory protection,
shared-memory-based message passing, Unix-like multiuser capabilities,
and many more stuff, highly tailored to multimedia applications!

Best regards,
The ERA team!
